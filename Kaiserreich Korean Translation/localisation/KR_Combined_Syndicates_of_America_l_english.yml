### Reconstruction Focuses ###
CSA_rebuilding_the_country:0 "국가 재건"
CSA_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "위대한 미국 혁명은 종료되었습니다. 그러나 내전의 상처는 우리를 계속 출혈시키며 약화시키고 있습니다. 따라서 과거의 폐허로부터 우리는 반드시 평등하고 공정하며 오래가는 미국을 서둘러 만들어야 할 필요가 있습니다.“
CSA_social_revolution:0 "사회 혁명"
CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "자유의 땅과 용자들의 고향은 중요합니다. 우리는 미국의 부패와 인종주의 그리고 쇼비니즘을 모두 치우고 절단해야 합니다. 그러나 가장 중요한 것은 이 모든 것의 핵심인 자본주의 체제를 파괴하는 것입니다!"
CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "재산 재분배"
CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "우리는 수백만 달러를 사용할 수 있으면서도 아무것도 안하는 사람들과 하루 동일 일하면서도 겨우 비참한 삶을 연장하는 수백만의 무산자 계급의 공존을 옹호하는 사회 질서를 더 이상 용인하지 않을 것입니다. 은행과 자본 축적가 그리고 기업가들은 모두 여기서 끝날 것입니다.“
CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "인민들에게 집을"
CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "지주들과 부동산 놀이터는 이 국가에 질병처럼 존재했습니다. 이제 힘 있고 부자인 사림들이 그들의 자리에서 쫒겨났기 때문에, 가난하고 빈곤자들은 그들의 슬럼에서 벗어날 수 있을 것입니다."
CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "모두에게 해방을"
CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "피부의 색깔을 기반으로 허세를 떠는 것과 같은 어리석고 헛된 것이 인민들에게 영향을 주고 있습니다. 어떤 인종이나 신념을 가지건 무산자들은 새로운 미국을 수립하기 위해 싸우고 분투해야 합니다. 또한 충직한 이민자들에게는 해방의 정신에 의거하여 본토인과 같은 시민권을 제공해야 합니다."
CSA_womens_liberation:0 "여성들의 해방"
CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "남자들이 전선에서 쓰러지는 동안, 여자들은 남자들을 대신하여 군수품을 만들고 공장을 운영하며 혁명에 기여하고 있었습니다! 자신들이 가진걸 모두 바친 수많은 여성 파일럿과 간호사 그리고 여성 민병대원들은 말할 것도 없을 겁니다. 그들의 희생과 분투는 이제 절대로 헛되지 않을 겁니다.“
CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "혁명 교육"
CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "교육 현장은 수많은 혁명가들을 양성했지만, 본질적으로 그 교육 체제는 계속 반동적이었습니다. 미국 역사에 있어서, 교육은 순종적인 노동자와 악한 자본가 그리고 양심 없는 정치인을 양성했죠. 그것을 끝낼 시간입니다!"
CSA_reconstruction:0 "재건 작업 착수"
CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "내전은 우리 국가의 많은 부분을 파괴했습니다. 많은 농촌들은 진흙과 유골만 남아있고, 수많은 도시들은 연기만 나는 파편이 되었을 뿐입니다. 따라서 우리는 새로운 집과 인프라를 가능한 건설하도록 노력해야 할 것입니다."
CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "연방주의자 처리"
CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "혁명이 일어날 때부터, 우리는 재판을 기다리는 많은 정치적 범죄자들이 쌓여있었습니다. 그리고 전쟁이 끝났기 때문에, 그들을 재판할 시간이 왔습니다. 비록 지도부 중 일부는 이들을 재건에 참여시킬 수 있다고 생각하지만, 다른 급진적인 동무들은 강력한 혁명적인 재판을 요구하고 있습니다.“
CSA_transformitive_justice:0 "변형의 재판"
CSA_transformitive_justice_desc:0 "비록 우리가 구 미국 엘리트들을 처리했지만, 아직도 우리의 새로운 체제에 반대하는 상당규모의 대중적 운동이 여전히 존재합니다. 우리는 우리가 승리했다고 안심하기 전에 이러한 남아있는 반혁명적 조직을 가라앉히고 우리 사이의 매 마지막 침입자까지 추격해야 합니다.“
CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "미국 우선주의자 처리"
CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "휴이롱를 추종하는 어리석은 반동적인 선동자들과 비인간적인 산업가들 그리고 독재적인 장군들은 마침내 재판에 서게 되었습니다. 비록 휴이 롱은 해외로 도주하였지만, 우리는 그와 협조한 사람들을 모두 공정하게 처벌 할 것입니다.“
CSA_destroy_jim_crow:0 "짐 크로를 파괴하라"
CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc:0 "남부 테러리스트들을 제거하는 것은 단순한 군사적 문제만은 아닙니다. 우리는 편협한 신앙과 인종차별주의 같은 미국에 수백년간 존재하던 역병을 뿌리 뽑고 롱에 대한 개인 숭배를 부술 것입니다. 우리는 링컨의 유산을 딕시들에게 최종적으로 전파 할 것입니다!"
CSA_equality_for_all:0 "모두에게 평등을"
CSA_equality_for_all_desc:0 "자유를 위한 오래된 전쟁은 거의 다 끝나갑니다. 구시대의 관습과 공포는 이제 사라졌고, 곧 미국에 있던 불의들은 사라지고 오직 씁쓸한 기억과 역사 책 속에서나 남을 것입니다.“ 
CSA_reconstruction_is_over:0 "재건 작업의 종결"
CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "이 국가가 저지른 범죄들은 마침내 씻겨 졌습니다. 심지어 구체제를 파괴하기 위해 과정에서 철과 피가 필요했어도, 우리는 과거에 폐허에서부터 새로운 세상을 일으켜 세웠습니다. 이 땅은 노동자들이 자유롭고 평등하며 번영하게 되었습니다.“
CSA_a_new_america:0 "새로운 미국"
CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "모든 세상에서 게으른 벌을 가지고 국가는 우리밖에 없을 겁니다. 우리는 광범위한 토대를 닦아 놓았으며, 하늘을 향한 돌을 쌓아 올렸습니다. 우리는 노예가 아니라 주인으로써 이 모든 것을 소유했습니다. 노동조합은 우리를 강하게 합니다!“   
### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
CSA_second_convention:0 "Second Constitutional Convention"
CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "The time has come to decide the next step in our revolutionary struggle, to find a way to unite workers behind a single cause and ideology. Like it was, over a century ago, we shall let Philadelphia be the site of a Constitutional Convention!"
CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of Labor"
CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "We did not come this far just to fall back into tyranny, our monumental support in the Constitutional Convention has shown that Libertarian Socialism will reign, not just in the form of hypocritical romantic nationalism, but as social and economic freedom for all workers and toilers of our nation! This will cover the first Amendments."
CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protect the Working Class"
CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "While many new ideas for a better economic system have existed in theory in America, the turmoil of the civil war made putting any of them into practice a difficult endeavor. Now though, we have ample time and opportunity to build the working man's Republic through Amendments protecting worker rights."
CSA_empower_councils:0 "Townhall Democracy"
CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "The new Commonwealth cannot be built through authoritarian means, we must pursue a better class character for our democracy. Through laws empowering grassroots engagement and townhall meetings, political decisions will no longer be a distant murmur on Capitol Hill, they will be right amongst the workers!"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "Mutual Economic Committee"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "Ending the capitalist system will be a herculean task, and it can't merely be wished away with state quotas and economic plans. Congress now begins assembling local political representatives, economists and workers to help direct the American transition from Free Market economics, to Socialism."
CSA_councilism:0 "Councilism"
CSA_councilism_desc:0 "Maintaining America's old bureaucracy is pointless, it has been so thoroughly plagued with reactionary ideals and concentrations of political influence, that a whole new delegation of power is needed. With workplace democracy already proving to be a roaring success, laying the foundations to council-based syndicalism shouldn't be implausible!"
CSA_federalism:0 "Federalism"
CSA_federalism_desc:0 "Even if the old United States was home to political corruption, jerrymandering and inefficient bureaucracy, its administrative system is an unshakable cornerstone of our national identity. We can't very well crush the connection our citizens feel to their home states, but we can certainly adjust the old flaws with statehood."
CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "Power to the People"
CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "Perhaps for the first time in our nation's history, true democracy is flourishing. Not the illusion of freedom, concocted by corrupted politicians and greedy businessmen, but real direct democratic means of governing our new Commonwealth! We enshrine this power in the unassailable Amendments."
CSA_federalist_economics:0 "Federalist Economic Policy"
CSA_federalist_economics_desc:0 "Many within the Combined Syndicates mock the idea of 'Market Socialism', calling it a betrayal of the revolution. What they fail the realize is that with 200 years of Capitalism in America, we will need an intermediary economy to ease the transition into socialism. Thus, Congress has passed laws to encourage price fixing to meet marginal cost."
CSA_mutualism:0 "Mutualism"
CSA_mutualism_desc:0 "Proudhon's theories of Mutualism will serve as a natural cornerstone to our reforms. We shall ensure that the work our laborers do will be of equal value to their efforts, not worth dictated by people like Long. Congress agrees, and has passed laws to de-regulate equity and empower Contract Free Association."
CSA_workers_cooperatives:0 "Worker's Cooperatives"
CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc:0 "The dominance of unions need not mean the death of enterprise! We shall simply rid ourselves of the bosses who take an unjust cut of the profits. Instead let the workers run their own workplaces, dividing the wealth fairly amongst themselves."
CSA_social_dividends:0 "Social Dividends"
CSA_social_dividends_desc:0 "Congress has passed a law instituting a basic universal income, wherein a portion of all profit generated from state run enterprises will be divided amongst our citizens. Our laborers are not just mere subjects, they're the very thing that keep our nation running, so they shall hereby be entitled to some of America's collective wealth!"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise:0 "Public Owned Enterprise"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc:0 "Public Enterprises were for a long time shunned in America, as countless of our old Presidents were beholden to the will of Big Business over their electorate. As we've now broken the yoke of corporations, Congress has finally legalized and enforced public ownership, and soon a prosperous American welfare state!"
CSA_american_syndicalism:0 "American Syndicalism"
CSA_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "America has finally left Capitalism behind, and entered into the first transitional period towards a brighter future. Though some in Congress still mock our idea of 'Syndicalism with American Characteristics', they cannot complain about when industries roar with energy, and our people celebrate yet unknown prosperity!"
CSA_unionist_economics:0 "Unionist Economic Policy"
CSA_unionist_economics_desc:0 "Although there has been some push for a synthesis between Syndicalism and American Capitalism, it’s obvious to us that there can be no compromise with the old system. Labor unions must rise to become the dominant force within our economy, unions now empower every extent of the Commonwealth government."
CSA_industrial_unionism:0 "Worker's Councils"
CSA_industrial_unionism_desc:0 "Whereas markets were previously decided by supply and demand, or the whims of investors, our new system will be built by and for the laborer. Congress has declared that workers shall be free to oversee their own communes and municipalities, with minimal interference."
CSA_workers_self_managment:0 "Worker's Self-Management"
CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "A great goal of this Congress is to remove the old hierarchies which permeated American workplaces. Thus, a law illegalizes Executive Officers and proportional stockholder voting rights. Now Unions can take control over all of the means of production!"
CSA_industrial_democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
CSA_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is integral to the American identity. Yet for far too long, whatever fig leaf of democracy was left at the factory door as Americans became slaves to petty tyrants. No longer. Congress has mandated a new Industrial Democracy committee to promote cooperation between unions towards a democratic goal."

It abolishes the concept of illegitimacy and entitled all children to parental support and equal rights under the law.

csa.69.d.vanguard:0 "Before the revolution, there were plans by William Z. Foster to implement an autonomous region within the South for the African-American community. With the ascension of William Z Foster comes a dedication to the dream to create a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the South of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress.

csa.71.t:0 "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
csa.71.d:0 "The only person to disgust President Browder more than Huey Long's populism, is Harry Leland Mitchell's betrayal of the unions. The USAS has strategically kept silent over the status of the the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, and has been slowly accruing defectors that refused to leave America. Now this long con has paid off, and a group of trusted Congressmen have smuggled Townsend back into America under the pretense of reconciliation. Townsend was immediately arrested in the first bugged hotel room he stayed in, and has become the main attraction in the largest Union Trial in American history. Townsend's fate was already sealed, but this trial will hopefully discourage any more dissidents within the IWW from thinking any reactionary thoughts."

It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the The International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivization. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of Trade Union Unity League members."
csa.72.a:0 "You're not God, Little Man"

csa.73.t:0 "Foster dissolves the AFL"
csa.73.d:0 "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labor leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labor by adoption industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence, allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labor."
csa.73.a:0 "Good Riddance to Lewis"

Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Daily Worker. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy. All were approved, and thus the mind of America is once again safe from pollution."

csa.75.t:0 "River Rouge Wildcat Strike Turns Deadly"
csa.75.d:0 "The workshops of the River Rouge Plant have been a known hotbed for violent activity. It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes to no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, Chairman Foster broadcast a new policy to America illegalizing Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."
csa.75.a:0 "It's what Reed would have done."


### General Flavor Event

Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular.

csa.81.a:0 "Thank you Dr. Salk"

csa.82.t:0 "Fate of the Boy Scouts"
csa.82.d:0 "A question has come up in regards to the Boy scouts of America. Some within congress regard it as a more reactionary organization, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end a number within congress believe that a Pioneer organization should be created similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe called the Pioneers of America. Unlike the Boy Scouts, this organization will be for both boys and girls and supported by the government, and help make sure that the new socialist ideas are passed down. "

Just like Anderson before him, he has chosen to embark on a world tour to spread his music and support for African American rights to Europe.

csa.86.t:0 "Unpolluting the Industrial Revolution"
csa.86.d:0 "In the old days of the Socialist Party, successes were measured by how clean your sewer system was. Especially in Wisconsin, where Morris Hillquit made it his campaign promise to clean up the city. In reforming and organizing public maintenance services, Hillquit showed that socialism could reorganize systems without having to redefine or destroy the foundations of the system. That principle of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation, now that the chains are broken.

However, people are divided as to what to do about the relief. Some believe that it should be destroyed.

csa.90.d:0 "Film montage, modernist writing, and the socialist spirit comes together in John Dos Passos's new book U.S.A. The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such an unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of extralegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemmingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by the Congress. "

csa.91.d:0 "With the revolution one of the changes that has come is the transformation in terms of vacations. The workers of America rarely got to enjoy all the luxuries that were created and the progressives would say 'belonged to the people'. How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visiting the national parks when they had to work as many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to have begun to take over and manage various cultural centers as well as help sponsor vacations. This is supported by the government at both a local level and national level as a way to boost productivity and encourage comradeship."
